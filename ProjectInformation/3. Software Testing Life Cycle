There are following six major phases in every Software Testing Life Cycle Model (STLC Model):

Requirement Analysis
Test Planning
Test case development
Test Environment setup
Test Execution
Test Cycle closure

What is Entry and Exit Criteria in STLC?
Entry Criteria: Entry Criteria gives the prerequisite items that must be completed before testing can begin.
Exit Criteria: Exit Criteria defines the items that must be completed before testing can be concluded

1. Requirement Phase Testing
Requirement Phase Testing also known as Requirement Analysis in which test team studies the requirements from a testing
point of view to identify testable requirements and the QA team may interact with various stakeholders to understand
requirements in detail. Requirements could be either functional or non-functional. Automation feasibility for the
testing project is also done in this stage.

2. Test Planning Activities
Preparation of test plan/strategy document for various types of testing
Test tool selection
Test effort estimation
Resource planning and determining roles and responsibilities.
Training requirement

3. Test Case Development Activities
Create test cases, automation scripts (if applicable)
Review and baseline test cases and scripts
Create test data (If Test Environment is available)

4. Test Environment Setup Activities

Understand the required architecture, environment set-up and prepare hardware and software requirement list for the Test Environment.
Setup test Environment and test data
Perform smoke test on the build

Test Execution Activities

Execute tests as per plan
Document test results, and log defects for failed cases
Map defects to test cases in RTM
Retest the Defect fixes
Track the defects to closure

Test Cycle Closure Activities

Evaluate cycle completion criteria based on Time, Test coverage, Cost,Software, Critical Business Objectives, Quality
Prepare test metrics based on the above parameters.
Document the learning out of the project
Prepare Test closure report
Qualitative and quantitative reporting of quality of the work product to the customer.
Test result analysis to find out the defect distribution by type and severity.
